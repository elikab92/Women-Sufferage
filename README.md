# Women-Sufferage
Project Documentation

 This project is about finding the attitude toward women before and after 1920 in novels and compares the results. Our assumption is that the attitude toward women after 1920 has become more positive; and the results from the project proves this. This projects finds the percentage of negative and positive and neutral words about women and compares them.

How to run the project?

First download the Final.py + post-1920-books.txt + post-1920-books.txt, and put all of them in the same folder. Then run the program (with python +3.0 â€“ this project was done by Python 3.7). To run the program, enter: python Final.py before 
This shows the results for the before 1920 and then run it again by: python Final.py after
Which shows the results of after 1920.
The results show the negative, neutral and positive percentages of the terms toward women among all the terms that are used about women.
